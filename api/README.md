# Front-end recruitment challenge: Agile board
Create a simple agile board web application using the REST API supplied.

- Your submission will be judged on *code quality* rather than aesthetics.
- You should only use the REST API supplied for persistence.
- You may use any libraries, frameworks or dependencies of your choice.
- Please include instructions for how to build and run your code.
- Don't forget to include any tests in the package.
- Keep the scope of your work limited as much as possible. You shouldn't spend
more than a couple of hours on the solution.

# Agile Board

An example agile board is shown below:

| Story | To Do | In Progress | Done |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- | ---- |
| As a product owner, I can create new stories so that I can request features | Create form for submitting new story | Create JSON fixtures for stories | Create example stories |
| As a developer, I can create new tasks for a story so that I can split it into work items | | Create JSON fixtures for tasks | Create example tasks |
| As a product owner, I can change story priorities so I can make sure that work is tackled in priority order | | | |
| As a developer, I can change the status of a task so that I can track my work | | | | |

Note that a story can have many tasks.

# Agile board API

The agile board API uses HTTP verbs and a RESTful endpoint structure.
Request and response payloads are formatted as JSON.

## Building, testing and running

To build, test and run the application use node package manager.

**Build**
```
npm install
```

**Test**
```
npm test
```

**Run**
```
npm start
```

## API summary

A complete REST operation is formed by combining an HTTP method with the full
URI to the resource youâ€™re addressing. For example, here is the operation to
create a new story:

```
POST http://localhost:3000/v1/stories
```

To create a complete request, combine the operation with the appropriate HTTP
headers and any required JSON payload.

A summary of the available API operations is listed in the table below:

| Action | Verb | Location |
| ------ | ---- | -------- |
| list stories | `GET` | `/stories` |
| create a story | `POST` | `/stories` |
| read a story | `GET` | `/stories/:story-id` |
| update a story | `PATCH` | `/stories/:story-id` |
| delete a story | `DELETE` | `/stories/:story-id` |
| list tasks | `GET` | `/tasks` |
| create a task | `POST` | `/tasks` |
| read a task | `GET` | `/tasks/:task-id` |
| update a task | `PATCH` | `/tasks/:task-id` |
| delete a task | `DELETE` | `/tasks/:task-id` |

## Current version

All requests should use the `v1` version of the API. This is expressed as the
first path in the URL. E.g.

```
http://localhost:3000/v1/stories
```

## Headers

`Accept` should be set to `application/json` for all requests.

`Content-Type` should be set to `application/json` for all `POST` and `PATCH` requests with a non-empty payload.

## Client errors

Standard HTTP semantics apply for client errors (`4xx` status codes), e.g. when
requesting a resource that does not exist you can expect `404 Not Found`.

Sending invalid JSON or incorrect JSON values for a resource will result in
`400 Bad Request`. E.g.

```json
{
  "message": "Body must be a JSON object"
}
```

## Resources

### Stories

A story is a high-level definition of a user's requirement, containing just
enough information for developers to produce a reasonable estimate of effort and
complexity. It captures which user want to achieve what and why in everyday
business language.

For the purposes of this web application every story has an associated priority,
persona (user type), feature summary and justification.

**Story model**

A story model contains the following fields:

|Field|Type|
|-----|----|
|id|uuid|
|created|ISO formatted date|
|modified|ISO formatted date|
|priority|integer|
|persona|string|
|feature|string|
|justification|string|

### Tasks

A task is an item of work within a story that can be worked on by a single
developer.

For the purposes of this web-application a task belongs to a single story and
every task has an associated priority, description and status.
